If data is added in an unsorted manner, the binary tree is going to be travelled plenty of times
to the left and to the right of each node until it can find a proper empty spot and place the new
piece of data. Always compared the new item to the current one and goes to the left if it is smaller
or to the right if it is bigger.

If the data is inserted in ascending order, the only branch ever taken is going to be the right one,
so basically this will be a LinkedList (with the possibility to take another branch) that replaces
the Node.next with Node.right as a moving factor.

If the data is inserted in descending order, the only branch ever taken is going to be the left one,
so basically this will be a LinkedList (with the possibility to take another branch) that replaces
the Node.next with Node.left as a moving factor.
